## Quickstart With Tina

```
$ yarn && yarn tina
```

This will install dependancies and open the website in your browser. Go to the [Tina Admin](http://localhost:3000/admin) to start editing.

## About

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/) and [Tina](https://tina.io/).

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn tina
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server. Go to the [Tina Admin](http://localhost:3000/admin) to start editing.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

To deploy to production and support editing on your live website, you can follow the steps from [Tina's docs](https://tina.io/docs/forestry/migrate/#deploy-tina-to-your-site).
